            <p>Tango is a musical genre and a dance, characteristic of the Río de la Plata region and its area of influence, but mainly of the cities of Buenos Aires (in Argentina) and Montevideo (in Uruguay). The writer Ernesto Sabato highlighted the "hybrid" condition of tango. The poet Eduardo Giorlandini highlights its Afro-Rioplatense roots, with the gaucho, Spanish, Italian culture and the enormous ethnic diversity of the great wave of immigration that arrived mainly from Europe. The researcher Beatriz Crisorio says that "tango is indebted to multi-ethnic contributions, thanks to our colonial past (indigenous, African and Creole) and the successive immigration contribution". Since then it has remained one of the musical genres whose presence has been become familiar throughout the world, as well as one of the best known.</p>

            <p>One of the main characteristics of this area is the existence of archaeological remains from the ancient Tafí culture (from 300 BC to 800 and from the Diaguita (or Santamariana culture): mortars, stone walls and menhirs (from the Celtic men=hir stone). = long) These, according to archaeologists, could be used to make astronomical measurements, sundials or as a symbol of some social or religious hierarchy.
                During the de facto military government, these archaeological monuments were displaced from their original places and today they are all together on a hill that has the name of Parque Provincial de los Menhires. The justification of the military government was that they did it to prevent theft and vandalism. These important monoliths over 2 millennia old, some reach 3 meters high and 6 meters wide, have one of their faces engraved with symbolic designs of vipers and human figures.</p>
            <p>San Miguel de Tucumán, sometimes simply called Tucumán, is the capital of the province of Tucumán, located in the northwest of the Argentine Republic, 1,311 km from the city of Buenos Aires. It is located very close to the right bank of the Salí River, also called the Dulce River. The Garden of the Republic and Cradle of Argentine Independence, are its best known nicknames.
                It is the fifth largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario, and Mendoza. It is also the most important city in the Norte Grande Argentino region. Its growth has exceeded the original limits, leading it to occupy the territories of the surrounding departments in all directions, thus giving rise to the Greater San Miguel de Tucumán conurbation, which is located, according to the 2010 census, as the fifth largest city. largest in the country.
                Its historical importance is mainly due to the fact that it was in this city where the Declaration of Independence of Argentina was produced, on July 9, 1816. That is why, since 1991, by Decree No. 81 of the National Executive Power, on July 8 and 9 of each year, the city of San Miguel de Tucumán symbolically becomes the capital of the country.</p>
