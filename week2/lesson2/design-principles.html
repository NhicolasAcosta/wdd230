                    Apple's website is an excellent example of the principles of white space 
                    and clean design. The sections have a maximum of 6 words per product, 
                    text in which we can see that it is hierarchical, this gives the user a lot 
                    of white space to breathe on the page, the product image is the main 
                    attraction. It is what will lead the user to fall in love with it and buy it.

            <div class="repetition">
                <h2>repetition</h2>
                <h3>Mercado Libre</h3>
                <a href="https://www.mercadolibre.com">www.mercadolibre.com</a>
                <div>
                    <img class="m-libre-img" src="/lesson2/images/m-libre.jpg" width="250px" alt="m-libre-website">
                </div>
                <p>
                    I consider Mercado Libre to be a great example of Repetition. On the web page we
                    can see that in addition to everything being well aligned, both the text and the 
                    images. There are many induced repetitions such as the green letters where the 
                    greatest benefits of buying a product are seen, we also see that the products that
                    are on sale have a blue sign that says "deal of the day". This allows the user to 
                    navigate more efficiently on the website. Since if I only look for products on sale
                    I only look at the blue signs and if I have already seen a product the next thing I 
                    look for are the benefits that are in green.

                <h3>Amazon</h3>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a>
                <div>
                    <img class="amazon-img" src="/lesson2/images/amazon.jpg" width="250px" alt="amazon-website">
                </div>
                <p>
                    At Amazon we see clear examples of alignment. All products are aligned with 
                    each other in a grid. The texts are all aligned to the right and also with a 
                    hierarchy that allows identifying the information from the most important to the 
                    least important. All this makes it very easy to navigate the website and enjoy browsing.
